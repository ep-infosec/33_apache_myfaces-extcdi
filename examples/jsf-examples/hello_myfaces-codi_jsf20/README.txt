start the demo e.g. via:
mvn clean jetty:run-exploded -PjettyConfig -Dmaven.test.skip=true

this example also demonstrates cargo tests -> if a codi snapshot is build manually use (in the root of the project):
mvn clean install
or
mvn clean install -Pextended-manifest
(which adds the svn revision to the manifest)



build commands for this example:

build example with owb + myfaces-core2
mvn clean install

build example with owb + mojarra
mvn clean install -Denvironment=owb-mojarra

build example for a jee6 application server
mvn clean install -Denvironment=jee6


only open and start this example outside of the rest of the project. that's required due to the missing shade support.

For remote debugging:
MAVEN_OPTS
-XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Xmx1024m -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=5005,server=y,suspend=n



application server hints:

manual glassfish deployment:
cd [example root]
mvn clean install -Denvironment=jee6
//cd target to see the war-file - in case of demo-apps the file is usually very small < 1mb
asadmin start-domain
asadmin deploy "[path to war-file]"
//find out the name of the deployed application(s): asadmin list-applications
//start the browser and enter the url http://localhost:8080/[name of the deployed applications]
//enjoy the application

//undeploy an application:
asadmin undeploy [name of the deployed applications]

//stop the domain
asadmin stop-domain
