This module just works in combination with OWB until the @Alternative approach of Weld is fixed.
Due to a weld bug (see WELD-905) and to keep the implementation in a central module, we can't annotate the original implementation with @Alternative

For weld see the readme-file of the alternative-configuration-weld module.
